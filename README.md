The above is the Gromac file. There are 2 types of molecules. ZMYH and NUIE. I would like to do the following 1. find the residue number of the molecule ZMYH with its nearest neighbor to the next molecules,NUIE. 2 along with its shortest distance. find the residue number of the molecule with its nearest neighbor to the next molecules among NUIE only along with its shortest distance, 3. find the intermolecular distance among NUIE molecules using KD-trees  algorithm 4. Save all the data. 5.  plot the above intermolecular distance as probability density histogram for point 3. 6. find the mean and standard deviation of the probability density histogram distribution for point 5.
